- diplicated request calls to airport.json file
  - check everytime input updates
  - unnessary request calls
  - could store the search data in a var
  - could copy all the json data in the same js, prevent request calls

- build a json file with lat and lng
  - pros: no need for API calls
  - cons: public data, usually should work with back end developer to work on a large data set
